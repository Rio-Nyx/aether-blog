- Search-in feature
- private mode
- fully customisable

The gnome alternative for kdeconnect. Very much useful if you are an android user. Lets you control your system from your android system and vice-versa through a local server (which means both have to be connected to same network).

- Run custom commands on your system from android mobile
- android system can act as virtual keyboard and mouse
- can sync files and clipboard
- custom keyboard shortcuts
- All-in-all controls and access every part securely
