## [Clipboard Indicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/)

One of the most handy desktop extensions. Ever wanted to paste the content you copied earlier, but it got overwritten. Clipboard Indicator got you covered. It lets the user save multiple copied items (~ 50). You just dont have to do anything else than installing it.
