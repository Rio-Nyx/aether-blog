The gnome alternative for kdeconnect. Very much useful if you are an android user. Lets you control your system from your android system and vice-versa through a local server (which means both have to be connected to same network).

- Run custom commands on your system from android mobile
- android system can act as virtual keyboard and mouse
- can sync files and clipboard
- custom keyboard shortcuts
- All-in-all controls and access every part securely

## 3. [Desktop Icons NG (DING)](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2087/desktop-icons-ng-ding/)

![](./images/desktop-icons.png)

Desktop icons were intentionally removed by gnome developers way long ago since they thought that window screen is not a place to be cluttered by folders and files
But some people like to be cluttered. It enables easy acess of cerain folders and files. And personally I feel that desktop icons make the screen looks much mpre good.And this can achioeved by the extenison called desktop-icons (and thankfully its still maintained).

- create shortcuts on desktop
- easy usage

## 4. [Time++](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1238/time/)

Ever wanted an easily accessible pomodro timer and alarm clock. What about a cliche but productive todo app. Time++ got you covered. Its a package of todo.txt manager, time tracker, timer, stopwatch, pomodoro, and alarm clock. Really cool, ain't it?

- really simple interface
- independently customisable
